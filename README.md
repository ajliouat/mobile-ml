# Mobile-First ML Pipeline

End-to-end pipeline for deploying efficient ML models on mobile devices. Features include model optimization, hardware-specific acceleration, and battery-aware inference.

## Features
- Custom quantization strategies
- Metal/CoreML performance optimizations
- Battery-aware model switching
- Edge-specific architecture design
- Real-time inference optimizations

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow Lite
- CoreML Tools
- ONNX Runtime

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

To run the mobile inference pipeline:
```bash
./scripts/run_inference.sh --config configs/config.yaml
```

---

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file is the central configuration for the project. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
model_path: "models/model.tflite"  # Path to the model
input_source: "data/sample_data.tflite"  # Input data source
quantization: "int8"  # Quantization strategy (int8, float16, etc.)
hardware: "tflite"  # Target hardware (tflite, coreml, metal)
battery_threshold: 20  # Battery level threshold for model switching
```
